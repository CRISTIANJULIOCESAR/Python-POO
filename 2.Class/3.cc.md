# Cine Simulation - README

## Introduction

In this project, we will create a cinema as an object that includes daily showings, movies, seats, and theaters. We will use classes in independent code files for modularity and reusability.

## Class Integration and Reusability

### Seat Class

We define the `Seat` class, representing a seat in the cinema. Each seat has a row, a number, and can be marked as occupied.

```python
# SeatClass.py

class Seat:
    def __init__(self, row, number):
        self.row = row
        self.number = number
        self.occupied = False

    def mark_occupied(self):
        self.occupied = True
```

### Theater Class

The `Theater` class represents a theater in the cinema. Each theater has a name, a type, and a list of seats.

```python
# TheaterClass.py

class Theater:
    def __init__(self, name, theater_type, seat_list):
        self.name = name
        self.type = theater_type
        self.seats = seat_list
```

### Movie Class

The `Movie` class represents a movie. Each movie has a name, description, genre, and duration. We also create a method to print all the movie's information.

```python
# MovieClass.py

class Movie:
    def __init__(self, name, description, genre, duration):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.genre = genre
        self.duration = duration

    def info(self):
        print(f"Movie: {self.name} \nDescription: {self.description} \nGenre: {self.genre} \nDuration: {self.duration}")
```

### Screening Class

The `Screening` class represents a movie screening. It includes a movie, a theater, and a schedule. Methods are included to print screening information, occupy a seat, start the screening, and finish the screening.

```python
# ScreeningClass.py

class Screening:
    def __init__(self, movie, theater, schedule):
        self.movie = movie
        self.theater = theater
        self.schedule = schedule
        self.started = False
        self.finished = False

    def info(self):
        print(f"Movie: {self.movie.name}, Theater: {self.theater.name}, Type: {self.theater.type}, Schedule: {self.schedule}")

    def occupy_seat(self, seat_index):
        self.theater.seats[seat_index].mark_occupied()

    def start_screening(self):
        self.started = True

    def finish_screening(self):
        self.finished = True
```

### Cinema Class

The `Cinema` class represents a cinema. It includes the name of the cinema, its address, and the list of screenings for the day. Methods are provided to get cinema information, show available screenings, and get the status of seats in a screening.

```python
# CinemaClass.py

class Cinema:
    def __init__(self, name, address, screenings):
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
        self.screenings = screenings
        self.open = True

    def info(self):
        print(f"Cinema: {self.name} \nAddress: {self.address}")

    def show_screenings(self):
        print("\nToday's available screenings:\n")
        for screening in self.screenings:
            if not screening.finished:
                screening.info()

    def get_seat_status(self, screening_index):
        self.screenings[screening_index].movie.info()
        for seat in self.screenings[screening_index].theater.seats:
            status = "Occupied" if seat.occupied else "Available"
            print(f"{seat.number}{seat.row} Status: {status}")
```

### Main Script

The main script `main.py` integrates all the classes. We will create instances of `Seat`, `Theater`, `Movie`, `Screening`, and `Cinema`, and demonstrate their interactions.

```python
# main.py

from SeatClass import Seat
from TheaterClass import Theater
from MovieClass import Movie
from ScreeningClass import Screening
from CinemaClass import Cinema

# Creating seats
seatA1 = Seat("A", 1)
seatA2 = Seat("A", 2)
seatA3 = Seat("A", 3)
seatB1 = Seat("B", 1)
seatB2 = Seat("B", 2)
seatB3 = Seat("B", 3)

# Creating seat list
seats = [seatA1, seatA2, seatA3, seatB1, seatB2, seatB3]

# Creating theaters
theater1 = Theater("Theater A1", "Regular", seats)
theater2 = Theater("Theater A2", "VIP", seats)
theater3 = Theater("Theater A3", "3D", seats)

# Creating movies
movie1 = Movie("Inception", "A skilled thief enters people's dreams to steal valuable information.", "Sci-Fi, Action, Thriller", "2 hours 28 minutes")
movie2 = Movie("Jurassic Park", "A dinosaur-themed park turns chaotic when the dinosaurs escape.", "Sci-Fi, Action, Adventure", "2 hours 7 minutes")

# Creating screenings
screening1 = Screening(movie1, theater1, "12:00PM")
screening2 = Screening(movie2, theater2, "12:00PM")
screening3 = Screening(movie1, theater3, "12:00PM")
screening4 = Screening(movie2, theater3, "02:00PM")

# Creating screening list
screenings = [screening1, screening2, screening3, screening4]

# Creating cinema
cinema = Cinema("Cin√©polis Diana", "Paseo Reforma", screenings)

# Using cinema functions
cinema.info()
cinema.show_screenings()

cinema.screenings[0].finish_screening()
cinema.show_screenings()

print("____________________________________________")
cinema.get_seat_status(0)

cinema.screenings[0].occupy_seat(0)
cinema.screenings[0].occupy_seat(3)
cinema.screenings[0].occupy_seat(4)

cinema.get_seat_status(0)
```

With this setup, we can efficiently manage the cinema's operations, demonstrating the power of class integration and reusability in Python.
